## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:




```{r}
library(tidyverse)
murders<-read.csv("data/murders.csv")
murders<-murders %>% mutate(region=factor(region),rate=total/population*10^5)
save(murders, file="rda/murders.rda")

load("rda/murders.rda")

murders %>% mutate(abb=reorder(abb, rate)) %>% ggplot(aes(abb,rate)) + geom_bar(width=0.5, stat="identity", color="black")
coord_flip()
ggsave("fig/barplot.png")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
